**Overview**

Using the MetaWeather API ( https://www.metaweather.com/api/) find the average max temperature in Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Boise for a 6 day forecast. In python, use threads and software development best practices to make each of the 3 api requests concurrently. Please create a GitHub repository to hold your code.
 
**Details**

The URLs to get temperatures for the 3 cities are:
Salt Lake City: https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2487610/
Los Angeles: https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2442047/
Boise: https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2366355/
According to the MetaWeather API each one of these API calls will return a field called "consolidated_weather". It contains a weather forecast for the city for each day including today and the next 5 days. Each forecast includes a field called "max_temp" that is the max temperature for that forecasted day. Find the average of max_temp for all forecasts for the city.
 
**Expected Output**
 
Salt Lake City Average Max Temp: 35.73

Los Angeles Average Max Temp: 29.84

Boise Average Max Temp: 32.63
